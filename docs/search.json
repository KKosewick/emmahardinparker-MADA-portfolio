Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

It has some NA values that are character strings instead of actual NAs, so we’ll need to code those as true missing values. Then we’ll make it a factor variable as well.

It looks correct, so we are done.\nAll done, data is clean now.\nLet’s assign at the end to some final variable, this makes it easier to add further cleaning steps above.\n\nprocesseddata &lt;- d5\n\n\n\nSave data\nFinally, we save the clean data as RDS file. I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\n  \"starter-analysis-exercise\",\n  \"data\",\n  \"processed-data\",\n  \"processeddata2.rds\"\n)\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

While at Furman, I had the opportunity to intern and work with the Institute for the Advancement of Community Health (IACH) as an evaluation coordinator. Throughout my time at IACH, I had the privilege of working with community partners such as LiveWell Greenville, the Well-Being Partnership of Greenville (WBP), and the Greenville County School System on various evaluation projects. My main research and evaluation efforts were geared towards childhood obesity, food access, ad mental health, One of my main projects was assisting in the development of a Mental Health Indicator Dashboard for the WBP.\n\n\nSoftware Experience & Looking Forward\nI have experience with RStudio, LaTeX, and RMarkdown from previous coursework and evaluation projects. However, I am looking to finish this class with a greater understanding of RStudio as it particularly relates to LaTeX and RMarkdown. Additionally, I am excited to be exposed to new programs and softwares! Mainly, I am looking to become more comfortable performing analyses on a variety of different data and to gain more professional knowledge of these programs. With my minor in Data Analytics, I was allowed the exposure to statistical analysis, specifically in R.\n\n\nMe outside of Academia!\nIn my free time, my favorite thing to study is beer! I am currently working toward my second level of certification under the Cicerone Program which is, for lack of a better word, a program geared to helping individuals become “sommeliers” of beer. When I am not in class or in the library, you can most likely find me behind the bar at Creature Comforts. One of the main perks of working at a brewery is being exposed to the analytics involved in brewing beer! This article explains how Beer30 software can be used to better manage brewing data as a whole and increase predictive analysis measures. Come by and grab a pint!"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files.\nAnd sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n# Setup\n```{r}\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\nLoad the data.\n```{r}\n#Path to data. Note the use of the here() package and not absolute paths\ndata_location &lt;- here::here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“data”,“processed-data”,“processeddata.rds”)\n#load data\nmydata &lt;- readRDS(data_location)\n```\n# Data exploration through tables\nShowing a bit of code to produce and save a summary table.\n```{r}\nsummary_df = skimr::skim(mydata)\nprint(summary_df)\n# save to file\nsummarytable_file = here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“results”, “tables-files”, “summarytable.rds”)\nsaveRDS(summary_df, file = summarytable_file)\n```\nWe are saving the results to the `results/tables` folder. Structure the folders inside `results` such that they make sense for your specific analysis. Provide enough documentation that someone can understand what you are doing and what goes where. `readme.md` files inside each folder are a good idea.\n# Data exploration through figures\nHistogram plots for the continuous outcomes.\nHeight first.\n```{r}\np1 &lt;- mydata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Height)) + geom_histogram()\nplot(p1)\nfigure_file = here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“results”,“figures”,“height-distribution.png”)\nggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p1)\n```\nNow weights.\n```{r}\np2 &lt;- mydata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Weight)) + geom_histogram()\nplot(p2)\nfigure_file = here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“results”,“figures”,“weight-distribution.png”)\nggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p2)\n```\nNow height as function of weight.\n```{r}\np3 &lt;- mydata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Height, y=Weight)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=‘lm’)\nplot(p3)\nfigure_file = here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“results”,“figures”,“height-weight.png”)\nggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p3)\n```\nOnce more height as function of weight, stratified by gender. Note that there is so little data, it’s a bit silly. But we’ll plot it anyway.\n```{r}\np4 &lt;- mydata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Height, y=Weight, color = Gender)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=‘lm’)\nplot(p4)\nfigure_file = here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“results”,“figures”,“height-weight-stratified.png”)\nggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p4)\n```\n# Notes\nFor your own explorations, tables and figures can be “quick and dirty”. As long as you can see what’s going on, there is no need to polish them. That’s in contrast to figures you’ll produce for your final products (paper, report, presentation, website, etc.). Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."
